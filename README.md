# RAVDESS Emotion Classification

This project is a fork from the origianl implementation at [marcogdepinto/emotion-classification-from-audio-files](github.com/marcogdepinto/emotion-classification-from-audio-files) with focus on adding new voice features and increasing the accuracy.

‚ÄçThe added voice features are:

- melSpectrogram
- Contrast
- Chroma
- Tonnetz

---

The development is temporarily suspended until I get a good grasp on CNNs.

Meanwhile, all the recommendations and issues are welcomed while I watch the [Convolutional Neural Networks course by Andrew NG](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning).
